# eXtreme Programming

## Discovering through examples

---

## What is eXtreme Programming?

----

> Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

----

## Yet another agile bullshit?

---

## Quick Reminder!

----

## SCRUM

- Focus on stories, estimations, priorities, reporting...
- Targets the project organization, not really its realization.
- Agile methodology for project managers.

----

## SCRUM

Going from *client specifications* to prioritized *User Stories*.

----

## SCRUM

A methodology for writing Jira tickets.

----

## SCRUM

It's an **organisational** methodology. It describes how to organize the tasks, not how to actually do them.

----

## Kanban?

Just some lightweight SCRUM.

----

## SAFe?

Just some heavy SCRUM.

----

## eXtreme Programming

- A methodology focusing on **how we do stuff**.
- Clearly dedicated to developers.

----

## eXtreme Programming

Takes values from the *Agile Manifesto* but isn't limited to developers working in an agile environment. 

----

## eXtreme Programming

Going from a *specified task* to the *actual source code*.

Including analysis, design, architecture, and actually writing the code.

----

## eXtreme Programming

Aiming at reaching the technical excellence part of the agile manifesto.

---

## Why is it needed?

----

Cause writing a code base isn't easy!

----

Writing a code base which allows regular changes is even harder.

----

In a not agile context, developers have specifications to work with. They can build a solid code base from their analysis, design and architecture.

----

In agile, they have short iterations, and unfinished specifications...

----

We expect from them that they code, quick. And whatever they built may change.

----

Which means they need to be trained and efficient. Otherwise, any agile approach won't work.

----

Agile isn't making projects successful anyway. So focus on your project's quality instead of methodologies.

----

Remember quality takes time and effort.

A 3 days task made in 2 days costs 5 days.

---

# Live Coding

----

We'll build a simple RPG simulator, with really easy rules. First with a naive implementation, then step by step with XP.

---

# Results

----

- Pair Programming
- KISS
- TDD
- Refactoring

----

## Naive Implementation

- Quick
- Looks easy

----

## Naive Implementation

- Maybe bugs?
- No corner cases
- No tests
- Can't be tested
- Messy and not readable

----

Our specification looks just fine isn't it?

---

Remember DEEP and INVEST?

---

Well, it's not detailed enough and moreover it's not testable!

---

TDD allows us to spot problem and to fix them!

----

TDD also stimulates creativity because we're talking about examples and real cases!

----

## TDD

- Tested
- Takes more time
- Trustable

----

TDD takes more time, but that's the cost of your software's quality.
